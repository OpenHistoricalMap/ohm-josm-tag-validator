# v0.4.0 — JOSM crash hotfix, autofix-safety guards, normalization wins

Originally scoped as a v0.3.3 hotfix for [#26](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/26) (a JOSM crash on tag values containing `{` or `}`). Bumped to v0.4.0 once the audit it triggered surfaced a class of autofix-safety bugs and the testing pass uncovered several normalization wins worth shipping in the same release.

## What was crashing

JOSM crashed (with `IllegalArgumentException: can't parse argument number: z`) whenever the validator examined a feature whose tag value contained literal `{` or `}` — most commonly tile-template URLs like `https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/{tileset}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. The crash bubbled up to JOSM's bug-report dialog and aborted the validation run.

## Why it happened

The plugin was using JOSM's `TestError.Builder.message(String, String, Object...)` API incorrectly. The 2nd argument is supposed to be a `marktr(...)`-style format template with `{0}` placeholders, with the substitution values passed as the variadic 3rd-onward args; JOSM then runs `MessageFormat` once with the args inserted post-parse, so braces in values are safe. The plugin was instead calling `tr(format, args)` itself and passing the *already-substituted* string to `.message(...)` as the description format. JOSM then ran `MessageFormat` on that pre-substituted string, and any literal `{` introduced by an interpolated tag value (most visibly `{z}` in tile URLs) crashed the `MessageFormat` constructor.

## What changed

- **All 64 `.message(...)` call sites** in `DateTagTest` and `TagConsistencyTest` rewritten from `.message(title, tr(format, args))` to `.message(title, marktr(format), args)` — the JOSM-correct idiom.
- **Build-time guard** (`test/MessageApiAuditor.java`, run by `ant test`) scans both validator source files and fails the build if the broken pattern is reintroduced.
- **Regression fixture** at `test/crasher_braces.osm` carries three primitives whose tag values exercise the previously-crashing description paths (bare `source:url` with `{z}/{x}/{y}`, non-URL `source` value with literal braces, two differing brace-bearing URLs).
- **Golden-file diff.** `ant test` now redirects RunTests' findings to `test/results.txt` and diffs against the committed `test/expected.txt`. Any drift in finding count, ordering, or text fails the build with a unified diff.

## Also fixed: source-family autofixes no longer silently overwrite existing keys

Companion bug class surfaced during the audit. Three rules wrote into source-family keys without checking whether the destination slot already held content. On features that had both the source being fixed AND a real value at the destination key, the autofix silently lost the destination value.

The fix splits each affected rule into two paths: autofix when destination slots are clear, unfixable warning when any destination slot is occupied. New codes 4321 / 4322 / 4323 carry the unfixable variants:

- **4306 (`move non-URL source tags to source:name`)** now only autofixes when the companion `source:name` (or `source:N:name`) is empty. The new **4321** fires the unfixable variant when it isn't.
- **4315 (`source contains multiple URLs; autofix by enumerating source:# keys`)** now only autofixes when none of the target `source:1`, `source:2`, … slots is occupied. The new **4322** fires the unfixable variant when any is.
- **4316 (`source contains multiple text strings; autofix by enumerating source:#:name keys`)** now only autofixes when none of the target `source:name`, `source:1:name`, … slots is occupied. The new **4323** fires the unfixable variant when any is.
- **4233 (`Invalid date - Julian date`)** now only autofixes when the target `*_date:note` is empty. The autofix writes a synthesised calendar-conversion note into `:note`, and `:note` is OHM's slot for human-meaningful annotation, so an existing value is exactly the kind of content that must not be silently overwritten. The new **4240** fires the unfixable variant when `:note` is already populated.
- **4203 / 4204 (decade/century normalization)** and **4221 (`end_date=present`)** now check the target `*_date:raw` slot before writing. If it already holds a different value, the new **4242** fires the unfixable variant. Same shape as 4321/4322/4323/4240: name both the proposed and existing values so the editor can decide.

The unfixable variants name the occupied slot and its current value so the editor can decide whether to merge, replace, or shift the split to higher indices.

## New: 4243 — boundary chronology has non-relation members

Per [issue #21](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/21), a "boundary chronology" — defined as a `type=chronology` relation with 2 or more `type=boundary` relations as members — must contain only relation members. Non-relation members (ways, nodes attached directly) indicate the contributor mistakenly bypassed the member boundary relations and attached the geometry to the chronology instead. Severity ERROR.

The 2+ threshold avoids flagging single-boundary chronologies (degenerate cases the editor probably hasn't finished assembling).

## New: 4236 boundary-gap variants

Per [issue #22](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/22), the chronology gap rule (4236) now fires for **two new boundary cases** in addition to the existing "gap between consecutive members":

- **Gap between parent `start_date` and the oldest member's `start_date`**, when the gap exceeds 1 unit at the coarser shared precision. e.g. chronology declares `start_date=0100` but the oldest member relation starts at `0300` — 199-year gap at the start.
- **Gap between the latest member's `end_date` and parent `end_date`**, same threshold. Skipped entirely if any eligible member is open-ended (no `end_date`), since open-ended coverage extends to infinity.

Both variants use the same code (4236), severity, and overall description shape as the original consecutive-pair gap. The titles differentiate the three cases. Real OHM data turns out to have plenty of these — ~14 boundary gaps fire across the regression dataset.

## Generalization: source/source:url consolidation now handles every `source[:N]?:url`

Per [issue #27](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/27), rules 4311 / 4312 / 4313 (`source` vs `source:url` consolidation) now apply to every `source[:N]?:url` key on a primitive, not just the literal `source:url`. So a feature with `source:1:url=https://...` gets paired against `source:1`, `source:7:url` against `source:7`, etc. Per-pair, the four existing sub-cases (blank companion → rename, identical values → delete duplicate, both URLs → move to next free `source:N` slot, text companion → swap with `:name`) run independently.

The fix descriptions name the actual key pair so the editor sees `source:1:url=... should live in source:1` rather than the static `source:url should live in source`. The autofix targets are derived per-pair: text→name swap on `source:1` writes to `source:1:name` (not `source:name`).

## Suppression: 4303 (`Missing tag - source on named feature`) skips chronology relations

Per [issue #23](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/23), `type=chronology` relations are now exempt from the missing-source warning. They're aggregator wrappers around member relations (each of which carries its own provenance), so requiring a top-level source on the chronology itself adds noise without signal. ~3 chronology relations in the regression dataset stop firing this warning.

## Behavior change: 4212 / 4213 are now unfixable

`[ohm] Suspicious date - 01-01 start_date` (4212) and `[ohm] Suspicious date - 12-31 end_date` (4213) previously offered a one-click autofix to trim to the bare year (`start_date=1875-01-01` → `start_date=1875`). Per [issue #28](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-josm-tag-validator/issues/28), these are now unfixable WARNINGs. Jan 1 and Dec 31 are legitimate real dates often enough (laws taking effect, treaties signed, terms ending, fiscal year boundaries) that even an opt-in autofix proved too easy to apply by mistake when batch-fixing. The descriptions still suggest the manual trim for the false-precision case.

## Also fixed: abbreviated-tail and implausibly-ancient range normalization

Two normalization fixes that surfaced during testing:

- **`YYYY/YY` abbreviated-tail range** (e.g. `1716/17`, `1850/52`). Pre-fix, edtf-java accepted the short form as valid EDTF and produced wildly wrong base values — `end_date=1850/52` came out as `end_date=5299`. Now expanded to the full pair before normalization: `end_date=1850/52` → `end_date=1852, :edtf=1850/1852, :raw=1850/52`. For `start_date`, the base is the lower year; for `end_date`, the upper. Wrap cases like `1899/01` (where the suffix would resolve to a year less than the start) deliberately fall through and are not autofixed.

- **`0000..YYYY` implausibly-ancient range** (e.g. `0..1850`, `00..1900`). When the upper bound `YYYY > 400`, the validator now collapses the leading-zeros placeholder to the open-start EDTF form `/YYYY` and uses `YYYY` as the base. `start_date=0..1850` → `start_date=1850, :edtf=/1850, :raw=0..1850`. Below the threshold the input could be a real ancient range; falls through.

Dozens of rows in real OHM data flip from broken or ambiguous output to clean form on these two paths alone.

## Also fixed: cYYYY shorthand normalization

Pre-fix, the compact `cYYYY` shorthand (e.g. `start_date=c1920`) flowed through the existing decade/century pipeline and produced **invalid EDTF output** like `start_date:edtf=1919XX` — a malformed string that JOSM's downstream EDTF check would then re-flag, leaving the user worse off than before they accepted the fix.

The validator now handles `cYYYY` shorthand in five magnitude/sign cases:

- **`abs(YYYY) >= 100`** — unambiguous "circa year": rewrite to the canonical EDTF `~YYYY` triple. `c1920` → `start_date=1920, :edtf=1920~, :raw=c1920`. `c-1500` → `start_date=-1500, :edtf=-1500~`. `c1920bc` flips the sign directly with no N-1 offset → `start_date=-1920, :edtf=-1920~`.
- **`22 <= YYYY <= 99`** — ambiguous between "circa year YY" and "the YYth century". Fires the new **4241** unfixable warning. Manual review required to pick one.
- **`1 <= YYYY <= 21`** — highly probable positive century shorthand. Continues to flow through the existing CN/YY00s century pipeline unchanged (so `c19` is still treated the same as `1800s`).
- **`-99 <= YYYY <= -1`** — negative magnitudes ≤ 21 (e.g. `c-19`) and the full negative ambiguous band. The existing CN pipeline silently strips the sign and produces a CE century, so these values now fire **4241** as well.
- **`YYYY == 0`** (`c0`, `c-0`, `c0bc`) — degenerate. Year zero / century zero are both nonsense in OHM's astronomical-year convention. Fires **4241**.

The `c` prefix is case-insensitive and accepts a `bc` / `BCE` suffix.

## Side benefit: apostrophes are now rendered correctly

The old double-`MessageFormat` path was silently stripping apostrophes from message text — both from format-string literals (e.g. `'https://'` came out as `https://`) and from tag values that contained apostrophes (e.g. `d'ouvrage` → `douvrage`). The single-pass path renders these correctly. ~20 finding descriptions across the regression dataset now read more naturally; no wording was deliberately changed.

# v0.3.2 — wikidata rule detune, historic-tag and historic-in-name warnings, year-boundary swap, icon polish

## New: `[ohm] Name warning - "historic" in name` (4320, WARNING)

Companion rule to 4319 (suspicious `historic=*` tag): any name-family value containing the word `historic` (at a word boundary, so `historic`, `Historic`, `historical`, `Historical` all trigger; `prehistoric` does not) trips the rule. OHM's time-aware data model wants the entity's name as it would have been used at the time it existed, not a present-day historicizing label.

## Year-boundary fixability swap (4212/4213/4214)

The fix-vs-no-fix policy on year-boundary dates is reversed:

- `start_date=YYYY-01-01` (4212) and `end_date=YYYY-12-31` (4213): now **autofixable** by trimming to bare-year. These sit at the year boundary that matches the role — under OHM's conservative year-only convention, the trimmed form bounds the same calendar year the explicit form does, so trimming is safe.
- `start_date=YYYY-12-31` (4214) and `end_date=YYYY-01-01` (4214): now **unfixable, please review**. These sit at the *opposite* year boundary for the role. Could be a typo (year-±1 intended) or a legitimate event-day start/end; ambiguous, so manual review only.

This reverses the previous policy (where 4212/4213 were unfixable and 4214 autofixed by year-shifting). The earlier non-fix on 4212/4213 was a 2026-04 forum-feedback response to over-aggressive auto-removal; the v0.3.2 reasoning is that *these specific* trims (boundary-matches-role) are safe in OHM's data model, while the year-shift on 4214 was the actually-aggressive operation.

## Less noise from the missing-`wikidata` rule (4302)

`[ohm] Missing tag - wikidata` previously fired on every named feature without a `wikidata` tag, which over-fired on routine named buildings, local roads, and the like. It now fires only when the feature also carries a notability signal:

- Any `wikipedia=*`, `historic=*`, or `boundary=administrative`
- A notable value of `place` (city, town, village, hamlet, suburb, neighbourhood, county, state, country, region, island, archipelago, continent)
- A notable value of `tourism` (museum, attraction, monument, artwork, gallery)
- A notable value of `amenity` (place_of_worship, university, courthouse, townhall, library, theatre, hospital, school)
- A notable value of `building` (castle, cathedral, church, chapel, mosque, synagogue, temple, palace)
- A notable value of `military` (castle, fort, barracks)
- Or the primitive is a relation (relations almost always represent compound named entities)

In the bundled regression dataset, the rule's hit count drops from 268 to 73 — a 73% reduction.

## Wikidata QID autofix when `wikipedia=*` is set

If `wikipedia=*` is present but `wikidata` is missing, a fix is now offered that resolves the QID via the Wikidata API (`wbgetentities` against `<lang>wiki` site title) at fix-click time. The lookup is lazy — validation stays offline-fast. If the lookup fails (network error, missing article, no QID in response), the fix is a silent no-op.

## New: `[ohm] Suspicious tag - historic` (4319, WARNING)

OHM convention is that `historic=*` applies only to entities that have actually passed into history; using it on a still-current feature is premature. The rule fires once per feature carrying `historic=*` (any value), prompting the editor to confirm. Unfixable.

## Icon polish

The plugin icon's black background is now transparent. Same shield/checkmark glyph; cleaner blend with JOSM's plugin list.

## Shorter validator titles

Validator messages whose titles ended with content trailing "please review" (e.g. "; unfixable, please review and add a Wikidata QID", "; fixable, please review suggestion") are trimmed to end at "please review". The trailing detail still lives in the description field, so no information is lost — but the validator panel's row no longer wraps so eagerly, making the error count column easier to read.

# v0.3.1 — JOSM plugin registry submission prep

Pre-submission housekeeping for getting the plugin into the JOSM
plugin directory (so it appears in every JOSM user's *Available
plugins* list by default). No validator behavior changes.

- **Renamed** the plugin from `ohm-tags` to `OHM_Tag_Validator`. JOSM
  uses the jar/SVN-directory name as the user-facing string in its
  plugin list, and underscores render as visual spaces, so the new
  name reads almost like "OHM Tag Validator" in the UI. The Java
  package (`org.openstreetmap.josm.plugins.ohmtags`) is unchanged —
  only the build artifact and user-facing name have moved. The jar
  is now `dist/OHM_Tag_Validator.jar`.
- **Plugin-Minimum-Java-Version: 17** added to the manifest. The
  plugin already required JDK 17 because of the bundled `edtf-java`
  dependency; this just declares that requirement explicitly so JOSM
  doesn't try to load the plugin on older Java versions.
- **Plugin-Icon** added. The icon ships as `images/preferences/OHM_Tag_Validator.png`
  inside the jar and is what JOSM displays next to the plugin name
  in the plugin list.

# v0.3.0 — chronology rules, severity elevations, role=label warning

This release adds structural validation for OHM `type=chronology`
relations, elevates several malformed-date warnings to errors, and
adds a discoverability warning for relations carrying a `role=label`
member.

## New: chronology consistency rules (4234–4239)

`DateTagTest` now validates `type=chronology` relations as structural
units, not just their members in isolation. All comparisons use strict
`start_date` / `end_date` values in `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`
form (no EDTF, no `:raw`, no Julian). Touching boundaries at matching
precision (`A.end_date=1850` next to `B.start_date=1850`) are treated
as adjacency — the canonical OHM successor pattern — and never fire
overlap or gap.

- **4234 ERROR** — member date range outside parent chronology range
- **4235 WARNING** — member date range overlap (non-adjacent)
- **4236 WARNING** — gap between member date ranges (>1 unit at the
  coarser shared precision)
- **4237 WARNING** — member missing required date tag (the youngest
  member may legitimately omit `end_date`)
- **4238 ERROR** — member duplicate to its predecessor (identical in
  both non-date tags **and** geometry — recursive coordinate-based
  check, so different node ids at the same position still count as a
  duplicate; incomplete proxies treated as non-duplicate to avoid
  false positives)
- **4239 WARNING** — member without dates (neither tag present;
  takes precedence over 4237 on incomplete proxies to avoid double-
  reporting)

Findings select only the offending member(s); 4234 additionally
selects the parent relation since it represents a parent-↔-member
relationship.

## Severity elevations

The following codes are now `ERROR` (red) rather than `WARNING`:

- All `[ohm] Invalid date - …` titles previously at WARNING:
  **4202**, **4207**, **4221**, **4228**, **4231**, **4233**
- **4302** — basic missing `wikidata` tag on a named feature (the
  source-key-referenced variant **4309** stays at WARNING)

Plus the new chronology codes **4234** and **4238**.

## New: role=label warning (4318)

`TagConsistencyTest` flags any relation containing a `role=label`
member. OHM renderers generate label points server-side, so editor-
supplied labels are usually unnecessary; the warning directs the
editor to download all parent relations of the shared label object
(*File ▸ Download parent relations / ways*) before making changes.

# v0.2.1 — first public release

First public cut of **ohm-tags**, a JOSM validator plugin for
[OpenHistoricalMap](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/). The plugin
checks OHM-style date tags and source/name consistency, surfacing
errors and warnings in JOSM's Validation Results panel with autofixes
where possible.

## What's in the box

**Date validation (`DateTagTest`, codes 4200–4233)** — checks
`start_date`, `end_date`, and their `:edtf` and `:raw` siblings:

- Normalizes noisy human-entered values (`2003-03..2016`,
  `fall of 1814`, `400 BC`, `1800s`, `j:1582-10-15`) into canonical
  EDTF (ISO 8601-2)
- Flags ambiguous, suspicious, or invalid dates (Feb 30, calendar-
  invalid combinations, far-future values, year-boundary artifacts,
  inverted start/end ranges, trailing-hyphen typos)
- Detects EDTF accidentally placed in a base tag and offers to split
  it across `*_date` / `*_date:edtf` / `*_date:raw`
- Reconciles base ↔ `:edtf` mismatches and recovers the canonical
  triple from a `tagcleanupbot`-authored `:raw` value
- Converts Julian (`j:YYYY-MM-DD`) and Julian Day Number
  (`jd:NNNNNNN`) input to Gregorian, preserving the original in
  `*_date:note`

**Tag consistency (`TagConsistencyTest`, codes 4300–4317)** — checks
names, source attribution, and external identifiers:

- Warns on named features missing a plain `name` or `wikidata` tag
- Cleans up `source` / `source:url` / `source:name` / `source:N`
  tags: misformatted URLs, semicolon-separated lists, conflicting
  duplicates, swapped name/URL pairs
- Cross-checks `wikipedia` / `wikidata` references in attribute-
  source keys

See [`docs/MESSAGES.md`](docs/MESSAGES.md) for the full per-rule
reference, including before → after examples for every message.

## Notable choices in this release

- **Hybrid EDTF parsing.** Uses [`OpenHistoricalMap/edtf-java`
  0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/edtf-java) (Maven
  Central, BSD 2-Clause) as the source of truth for EDTF validity.
  The library is shaded into the plugin JAR — JOSM users don't need
  to install anything extra. OHM-specific input normalization (Julian
  conversion, BCE prose, decade/century shorthand, season expressions)
  stays in-tree as a thin shim that emits canonical EDTF for the
  library to consume.

- **Severity scheme.** Most messages are `WARNING`; malformed-date
  messages (4201, 4208, 4217, 4218, 4222) are `ERROR` so they show
  red in JOSM's validator panel.

- **Conservative autofixes.** No autofix is applied silently in
  cases where the input could plausibly be correct. For example,
  `start_date=YYYY-01-01` is now a no-fix warning (Jan 1 is a real
  date for many events); the off-by-one variant (`start=Dec 31` /
  `end=Jan 1`) does keep its autofix because it's a clearer typo
  signal.
